# Costco Membership Performance Dashboard

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize Costco membership performance. The goal was to turn raw membership data into clear, useful insights that help track growth, renewal trends, and overall performance.

The dashboard allows users to monitor key metrics such as total members, renewal rate, revenue trends, and regional performance. It includes interactive filters and drill-down features so users can explore data by region, state, and membership type.

**Key Features**

Interactive KPI cards for Total Members, Renewal Rate, and Revenue

Dynamic filtering using slicers (region, state, membership type)

Clean and structured dashboard layout for easy understanding

Drill-down capability to analyze trends at a deeper level

Data modeling using SQL and calculated measures using DAX

Built using dummy membership data for demonstration purposes

**Tools Used**

Power BI (dashboard development and visualization)

SQL (data preparation and structure)

DAX (calculated measures and KPI logic)

**Purpose**

This project demonstrates my ability to work with data, build interactive dashboards, and present insights in a way that supports data-driven decision making. It also reflects real-world business scenarios similar to membership-based retail environments.
